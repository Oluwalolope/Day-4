# ECX 4.0 21 Days of Code Challenge - Day 4

## Description
This repository contains the solution for Day 4 of the Engineering Career Expo 4.0 (ECX 4.0) 21 days of code challenge. The challenge was to create a function that takes in an array of objects containing properties: name, age, and level, and returns an array of strings where each string is a concatenation of all values contained in the object separated by a slash.

## Solution
I solved the challenge using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The core logic of the solution involves iterating through the array of objects, extracting the required properties, and concatenating them with slashes. I utilized array concatenation methods and the `join()` method on arrays to achieve the desired output.
